# Bandung

Too many contacts in your Whatsapp? Tired of seeing one-time contacts flooding your view? **Bandung** helps to _bundle_ up these contacts into one single Whatsapp chat. What's more? With each message you send, the easier Bandung differentiates the messages. After a while, you can even send messages without specifying who you are sending to!

**Bandung** is submitted to _RoboHacks 2021_ (organised by MLH). This is the last hackathon for two of the team members before they start their university education, and hence the app is named Bandung (a famous drink in Singapore).

### Features

Bandung is powered by _Twilio API_ (for Whatsapp messaging) and _Wit.AI_ (for training intents).

1. _Bundling_ up of one-time/temporary/bot contacts!
Everyone has these type of contacts, be it the local pizza shop, the dentist, your personal doctor, the plumber, or even a duty officer that you have to report to everyday. Condense all these chats into a single channel!

2. Facilitates easy reference by codifying name
You don't have to remember the people's numbers, or even need to save them to your contact list! Simply ```$add <code_name> <contact_number>``` (e.g. ```$add pizza 65656565```). The next time you have to Whatsapp the pizza store for ordering, just refer to them using ```@pizza <message>```. 

Example: ```@pizza can i have a large hawaiian pizza with 2 garlic bread?```

3. Keep track of conversations via ```@last```
Retrieve last sent messages with ```$last <code_name>```

4. Automate your sending of messages!
Each time you send a message with ```@<code_name>```, it will be used to train Bandung's Wit.AI app in the backend. This means that after sending a substantial amount of messages with Bandung, you no longer need the ```@person``` anymore! Simply just type your message and Bandung will automatically send it if the confidence level is more than _80%_!
